# Traefik + Keycloak Workshop — Workflow App

## Project Goal

Build a **Workflow application** with a full infrastructure stack, where:

- **Traefik** serves as the reverse-proxy / API gateway — all services available under a single address (e.g. `*.localhost`)
- **Keycloak** serves as the identity provider (IdP) — authentication, roles, Google OAuth integration
- **Workflow App** is a sample service demonstrating role-based access control (RBAC)

---

## Workflow Application Overview

A simple application for managing workflows. Each workflow is a document that moves through stages: **Draft → Submitted → Approved / Rejected**.

### User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| `creator` | Create new workflows, edit own workflows in Draft status, submit for approval |
| `approver` | View all workflows, approve or reject (from Submitted status) |
| `viewer` | View all workflows (read-only) |

### Workflow Statuses

```
Draft  ──▶  Submitted  ──▶  Approved
                       ──▶  Rejected
```

### Data Model (simplified)

```
Workflow {
  id: UUID
  title: string
  description: string
  status: "draft" | "submitted" | "approved" | "rejected"
  createdBy: string (user ID from Keycloak)
  createdAt: datetime
  updatedAt: datetime
  decidedBy: string | null
  decisionComment: string | null
}
```

## Learning Plan — Step by Step

The project is divided into **9 stages**. Each stage adds a new layer of knowledge and results in a working application state.

---

### Stage 1: Traefik — First Steps 🚦 ✅

**Goal:** Understand what Traefik is, how Docker auto-discovery works, and how to route traffic.

**What we do:**
- [x] Create `docker-compose.yml` with Traefik
- [x] Configure the Traefik Dashboard (`traefik.localhost`)
- [x] Add a simple `whoami` service as a routing test
- [x] Learn core concepts: **entrypoints**, **routers**, **services**, **middlewares**
- [x] Add labels in docker-compose for auto-discovery

**You now know:**
- How Traefik automatically discovers Docker containers
- How routing rules work (Host, PathPrefix)
- What the Traefik Dashboard is and how to read it

**Files:**
```
docker-compose.yml
traefik/traefik.yml          # static configuration
```

---

### Stage 2: Keycloak — Setup and Configuration 🔐 ✅

**Goal:** Run Keycloak behind Traefik, create a realm, users, and roles.

**What we do:**
- [x] Add Keycloak to `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL
- [x] Expose Keycloak through Traefik at `auth.localhost`
- [x] Create the `workflow` realm
- [x] Create roles: `creator`, `approver`, `viewer`
- [x] Create test users and assign roles
- [x] Create a `public` type client for the frontend

**You now know:**
- What realm, client, and roles are in Keycloak
- How to configure Keycloak via Admin REST API (repeatable, versionable)
- How network segmentation isolates the database from other services
- How Keycloak issues JWT tokens with roles

**Files:**
```
docker-compose.yml           # extended with Keycloak + PostgreSQL
.envrc                       # secrets loaded via direnv (gitignored)
.envrc.example               # template for other developers
keycloak/setup.sh            # Admin API setup script (realm/roles/users/client)
```

---

### Stage 3: Backend API — FastAPI with Authorization 🐍

**Goal:** Build a workflow REST API with JWT token validation from Keycloak.

**What we do:**
- [ ] Create a FastAPI project with CRUD endpoints for workflows
- [ ] Implement JWT token validation middleware (JWKS from Keycloak)
- [ ] Implement role-based authorization (RBAC)
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database (SQLAlchemy / SQLModel)
- [ ] Expose the API through Traefik at `api.localhost`

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Path | Role | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/workflows` | all | List workflows (filtered by role) |
| GET | `/workflows/{id}` | all | Workflow details |
| POST | `/workflows` | creator | Create new workflow |
| PUT | `/workflows/{id}` | creator | Edit workflow (draft only, own) |
| POST | `/workflows/{id}/submit` | creator | Submit for approval |
| POST | `/workflows/{id}/approve` | approver | Approve |
| POST | `/workflows/{id}/reject` | approver | Reject |
| GET | `/me` | all | Current user info |

**You will know:**
- How to validate JWT from Keycloak in FastAPI
- How to implement RBAC at the endpoint level
- How Traefik routes traffic to the backend

### Stage 4: Frontend — React with OIDC Login 🖥️

**Goal:** Build a user interface with Keycloak login (OIDC/OAuth2).

**What we do:**
- [ ] Create a React application (Vite)
- [ ] Integrate `keycloak-js` or `oidc-client-ts` for login
- [ ] Implement the flow: login → redirect → callback → token
- [ ] Display workflow list, creation form, approval buttons
- [ ] Show/hide UI elements based on roles
- [ ] Expose the frontend through Traefik at `app.localhost`

**You will know:**
- How the OIDC Authorization Code flow with PKCE works

│   │   ├── WorkflowForm.tsx
│   │   └── WorkflowDetail.tsx
│   └── api/
│       └── client.ts
```

---

### Stage 5: Google Login (Social Login) 🌐

**Goal:** Add Google login as an Identity Provider in Keycloak.

**What we do:**
- [ ] Register an application in Google Cloud Console (OAuth 2.0 Client)
- [ ] Configure Google as an Identity Provider in Keycloak
- [ ] Map Google attributes → Keycloak (email, first name, last name)
- [ ] Test the login flow: "Sign in with Google" button
- [ ] Configure a default role for new Google users

**You will know:**
- How Social Login / Identity Brokering works in Keycloak
- How to map attributes between providers
- How to assign default roles to new users

---

### Stage 6: Traefik Middlewares — Security and Optimization 🛡️

**Goal:** Learn Traefik middlewares — rate limiting, CORS, HTTP→HTTPS redirect, headers.

**What we do:**
- [ ] Add `rate-limit` middleware to the API
- [ ] Configure `CORS` headers for the frontend
- [ ] Add `security headers` (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Configure `compress` middleware (gzip)
- [ ] Add `retry` and `circuit-breaker` (optional)

**You will know:**
- How to chain multiple middlewares together
- How Traefik protects the application at the gateway level
- How to debug middlewares in the Traefik Dashboard

**Files:**
```
traefik/dynamic/            # dynamic configuration files
├── middlewares.yml
└── tls.yml                 # optional, for HTTPS
```

---

### Stage 7: Secure Service-to-Service Communication 🔗

**Goal:** Secure internal communication between microservices — so that services can call each other in an authenticated and encrypted way.

**Context:** In real-world systems, the backend is not a monolith. We have multiple services that need to communicate with each other. Questions that arise:
- How does Service B know the request really came from Service A, not from an attacker?
- How to encrypt traffic inside the Docker network?
- How to avoid passing user tokens between services?

**What we do:**

#### 7a. Keycloak Service Accounts (Client Credentials Grant)
- [ ] Create a new `notification-service` (simple FastAPI — sends notifications about workflow status changes)
- [ ] Register the service as a `confidential` client in Keycloak
- [ ] Implement the **Client Credentials Grant** flow — the service obtains a token from Keycloak on its own (without a user)
- [ ] Backend API calls notification-service with a service account token
- [ ] Notification-service validates the token and verifies it comes from a trusted client

#### 7b. mTLS — Mutual Certificate Authentication
- [ ] Generate a custom CA (Certificate Authority) and certificates for services
- [ ] Configure Traefik as the TLS termination point with client certificate verification
- [ ] Configure mTLS between Traefik and backend services
- [ ] Test — requests without a client certificate are rejected

#### 7c. Docker Internal Networks — Isolation
- [ ] Create separate Docker networks: `frontend-net`, `backend-net`, `db-net`
- [ ] Frontend can only see Traefik; backend can see Traefik + database
- [ ] Database is not accessible from outside or from the frontend
- [ ] Map rules: which service can talk to which

**New service — notification-service:**

```
notification-service/
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
└── app/
    ├── main.py
    ├── auth.py              # service account token validation
    └── notifications.py     # notification logic
```

**Communication diagram:**

```
┌──────────────┐   Client Credentials   ┌──────────────┐
│  Backend API │──────── token ────────▶│   Keycloak   │
│  (service A) │◀──── access_token ─────│              │
└──────┬───────┘                        └──────────────┘
       │
       │  request + Bearer token (service account)
       ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│ Notification Service │──▶ validates token (JWKS)
│     (service B)      │──▶ checks client_id / roles
└──────────────────────┘
```

```
  mTLS (optional):

  ┌────────┐   TLS + client cert   ┌────────────┐
  │Traefik │◄─────────────────────▶│ Backend API│
  │        │   mutual verification │            │
  └────────┘                       └────────────┘
       ▲
       │ TLS + client cert
       ▼
  ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ Notification Service │
  └──────────────────────┘
```

**You will know:**
- The difference between a user token and a service token (Client Credentials vs Authorization Code)
- How services authenticate each other without user involvement
- What mTLS is and when to use it (vs. regular TLS)
- How to isolate Docker networks to limit the blast radius
- How Traefik handles TLS termination and passthrough

---

### Stage 8: Traefik ForwardAuth + Keycloak 🔒

**Goal:** Move authorization to the gateway level — Traefik checks the token before the request reaches the service.

**What we do:**
- [ ] Configure `forwardAuth` middleware in Traefik
- [ ] Create an auth-proxy microservice (or use `oauth2-proxy`)
- [ ] Traefik forwards the request to auth-proxy, which validates the token with Keycloak
- [ ] If the token is valid — the request goes to the service, otherwise → 401
- [ ] Compare this approach with validation inside the backend itself

**You will know:**
- The difference between gateway-level vs. application-level authorization
- How ForwardAuth works in Traefik
- When to use one approach vs. the other

---

### Stage 9: Production — HTTPS, Monitoring, Best Practices 🚀

**Goal:** Prepare a near-production environment.

**What we do:**
- [ ] Configure HTTPS with Let's Encrypt (Traefik ACME)
- [ ] Add monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana (Traefik metrics)
- [ ] Configure logging (Traefik access logs, Keycloak events)
- [ ] Add health-checks to docker-compose
- [ ] Create `.env` and document configuration variables
- [ ] Write a `Makefile` with useful commands

**You will know:**
- How Traefik automatically renews SSL certificates
- How to monitor traffic and service health
- What the best practices are for this stack
